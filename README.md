# Capstone Python Project
End-to-End E-Commerce Data Analysis Using Python

Conducted a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis project on large-scale e-commerce datasets using Python to evaluate business performance across sales, logistics, and customer behavior metrics.

1. Data Collection & Preparation
Imported and consolidated multiple structured datasets (orders, customers, products, payments, reviews, and delivery details).
Performed extensive data cleaning, including:
Handling missing values and inconsistent entries
Removing duplicates
Converting data types (dates, categorical variables, numerical formats)
Standardizing column names and formats
Merged relational datasets using keys to create an integrated analysis-ready dataset.

2. Data Manipulation & Transformation
Created new calculated fields such as:
Revenue metrics (total sales, average order value)
Delivery time (actual vs. estimated delivery duration)
Order frequency and customer lifetime metrics
Aggregated data using groupby operations to analyze trends across categories, regions, and time periods.
Extracted time-based features (month, year, weekday trends) for seasonality analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover key business insights:
Sales Performance Analysis
Identified top-performing product categories and regions by revenue.
Analyzed monthly and seasonal sales trends.
Determined revenue contribution by payment type.
Evaluated average order value across different customer segments.
Customer Behavior Analysis
Analyzed purchasing frequency and repeat customer patterns.
Examined customer ratings and review trends.
Studied the relationship between delivery delays and customer satisfaction.
Identified high-value customer segments and behavioral patterns.
Logistics & Delivery Efficiency
Calculated delivery lead times and delay frequency.
Compared estimated vs. actual delivery performance.
Identified regions with higher logistics inefficiencies.
Assessed the impact of delays on review scores.
Payment Trends Analysis
Evaluated distribution of payment methods (credit card, debit, installments, etc.).
Analyzed installment usage patterns and their impact on order value.

4. Visualization & Reporting
Built visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present:
Revenue trends over time
Category-wise performance
Regional sales distribution
Delivery delay patterns
Customer rating distributions
Communicated findings through structured reports and dashboards.
Translated analytical results into actionable business recommendations.

5. Business Impact & Insights
Delivered data-driven recommendations that supported:
Optimization of logistics processes to reduce delivery delays.
Focus on high-performing product categories and regions to increase revenue.
Improvement in product quality based on customer feedback analysis.
Strategic decisions regarding payment options and installment offerings.
Enhanced customer satisfaction by identifying pain points in the order lifecycle.
